# Algorithms on the connection of lines

## CONN 1

The idea is to give service to all the dots on the map within the lines limit given.

This in the CONN algorithms is done via transfer. There are two types of nodes a singular node and a transfer node.

### Singular nodes
Singular nodes need to be able to connect all their dots in a reasonable manner, meaning for all the dots that are asigned to that node to be connected between themselves.

### Transfer nodes
The transfer nodes connect the singular nodes together connecting station clusters with station clusters. This nodes may expand into more than one station inside the singular node and they may do cross service in order to alleviate pressure in high transfer stations.

 As the stations upgrade better transfer nodes will be implanted in order to keep the conectivity of the station in a good manner according to its sizew
